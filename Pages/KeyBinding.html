              <h1>Dynamic KeyBinding System</h1>
              <p class="ParagraphStyle2">Dynamic KeyBinding System is a plugin created to aid in reconfiguration of keys at runtime, with customizable instruction template , keybinding menu system ,  keyicon mapping and dependency bindings allowing you to
                quicky start creating your own KeyBinding Menu and Instruction system in no time.</p>
              <p>Key reconfiguration at runtime is used in almost every game and is a very useful feature for game developers, with instructions to follow along for convenience of the user during gameplay is another feature used in conjunction with keybinding.
                This plugin combines both these extremely useful features and being inspired from the different techniques used in different types of games, adds a great deal of customizations to allow the user to quickly start implementing this feature according to project specific requirements.</p>

                   simply need to check out <span class="FunctionName2">Key-Icon</span> mapping to find the Icon connresponding to the given key bound to the given action.</p>

              <p class = "TextStyle1">If you are familiar with GameInstance classes, you must be aware that GameInstances are used to store variables between levels, and if you want to execute a block of codes at the beginning of the
                  game and not every level, you would rather write that code in your <span class="FunctionName2">GameInstance</span> class and not in PlayerController or any other classes. To initialize our KeyBinding System, we can conveniently
                  use <span class="FunctionName2">GameInstance</span> class.</p>
                  <img style="padding: 10px; width: 100%;" src="../Images/KeyBinding/GameInstanceAsset.png" alt="GameInstanceAsset">
              <p class = "TextStyle1">The static function <span class="FunctionName2">Initialize Binding Data</span> saves the changes to  your datatables in seperate files, to be accessible later.  It also creates and returns an instance to the keybinding object.
                This instance can be accessed later if saved in a variable.</p>

               <p class = "TextStyle1">Now every game has different requirements when it comes to how the KeyCustomization UI needs to be displayed and behave. You may choose to divide your Action mapping by categories, or you may keep everything together.
               You may also have Primary as well as Alternate Key mapping for the same action. Some games such as Assassins Creed Origins allow gamepad remapping as well, and also have the option to bind same key for two different actions without interfering the
               gameplay behavior.</p>
               <p class = "TextStyle1">Here we will learn how to create a simple KeyCusomization Widget which has the actions divided into Binding Categories and we will implement the Dependency Mapping feature in this example. This is not a simple
               drag and drop process but will help you get an idea and also understand the functionality that you need to get accustomed with in order to create your own KeyCustomization Widget.</p>

                grouped by Binding Categories. So we call the function <span class="FunctionName2">Get Binding Dependency Map</span>, which returns structures of our Binding Data grouped into categories, and also contains the dependency information.</p>

                  saved binding is updated in the cache, and fetch the updated Bindings accordingly. The function <span class="FunctionName2">Get Cached Binding</span> will return the modified as well as the unmodified bindings. It is important to clear the cache when we move on to other
                  widgets to prevent retrieving the unsaved Bindings.</p>
